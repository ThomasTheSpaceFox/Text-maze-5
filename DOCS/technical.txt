View Angle:
The engine simulates 3D using an 8 pixel vertical offset between the floor and walls. 
some overlays also have rotation specific graphics where perspective is needed. 


Shadow casting:
The engine features automatic shadow casting.
walls assumed to be above ground hight, as well as ALL interior tiles,
cast shadows on other exterior tiles.
also "land" tiles cast small shadows on liquids.
wall shadows are also slightly longer on these surfaces.
the player also has a "fuzzy circle" shadow.
