TEXT MAZE FORMAT 2 TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION

NODES. nodes are different from tiles. this is used for triggered events such as trig and look.
	all nodes have x and y attributes.
	TYPES:
	look: define text for the player character to "say" when he 
		looks around on a defined grid point.
	trig: trigger the player character to "say" text at a point.
	label: a small visible text label in the maze.
		note the "area" attribute:
		"i"=inside "o"=outside "b"=both inside & outside
		This determines the visibility of the label. it is possible to have
		separate labels for inside and outside on the same grid point.
	overlay: display overlay type: "type" at "x" and "y".
		some overlays feature characters that can act as "npc-like" entities
		perhaps someone giving a hint? perhaps with a label node?
		or perhaps some casual chat with the conv node? :)
		note the "area" attribute:
		"i"=inside "o"=outside "b"=both inside & outside
		This determines the visibility of the overlay. it is possible to have
		separate overlays for inside and outside on the same grid point.
		the optional "rotate" attribute can specify that the overlay be rotated.
		"0"=normal "1"=90 degrees "2"=180 degrees "3"=270 degrees
	walkable: force a gridpoint to be either "0" (walkable) or "1" (nonwalkable)
		notice how this doesn't affect the apperance of the tile.
	teleport: when the player reaches point "x" and "y", teleport the player to point "destx" and "desty".
	conv: when the player presses "t" at point "x" "y", spawn the conversation
		in the text span of the conv tag.
		each line is iterated, 1 at a time. see the included maze xml files for examples.
